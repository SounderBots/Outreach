# Starting an FIRST Lego League Challenge team

Starting a new team may seem daunting, but we are here to help! It a straightforward process once you figure out the team and logistics.

Before you start, know there are some other options.

## What FLL Team type is right for me?

### School Teams
- Many elementary and middle schools have FLL teams as clubs or part of curriculum.
- Teacher lead. Usually requires limited parent involvement.
- Easy to get involved. 
- Schools usually have constraints on time, funding, equipment and travel. Can be hard to be competitive if too constrained.

### Community Teams
- Parent or volunteer coached and operated
- Less constraints - you can decide what is right for team.
- Many competitive FLL teams are community teams.
- You have the option to start a new team or join an existing one. Community teams don't have constraints on who can join (vs. school teams)

### Businesses like Swerve and Blaze
- Have commercial space for tables and meets.
- Professionals who coach and manage team
- Student driven - some orgs discourage parent involvent.

## Starting a Community team
### Decide on your team and logistics
- Recruit students for you team.
  - Typical team size is 4-6 students.
  - It is better if are in a similar age range and friends
- 2-3 coaches to oversee and help.
- Space to place the board and meet.
  - Many teams do it out of garages - it works just fine. Just have good heaters for the winter months.
- Parent volunteers for site visits, chaperoning, etc.
- Come up with a great name for your team.
